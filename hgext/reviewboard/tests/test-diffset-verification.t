Manually upload a diff replacing the one present on the draft so that
the review requests DiffSet isn't verified.

  $ hg update .~1 > /dev/null
  $ echo bar > foo
  $ hg commit -m 'Bug 1 - Bar' > /dev/null
  $ hg export | rbmanage upload-diff 1 --base-commit `hg log -r .~1 --template '{node}'`

Attempting to publish the manually uploaded diff should fail because it
is not verified.

  $ rbmanage publish 1
  API Error: 500: 225: Error publishing: This review request draft contained a manually uploaded diff, which is prohibited. Please push to the review server to create review requests. If you believe you received this message in error, please file a bug.
