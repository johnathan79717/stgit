  $ rbmanage dump-user-ldap user3
  ldap username: user3@example.com

Create another user

  $ mozreview create-user user4@example.com user4password 'User Four [:user4]' --uid 2003 --scm-level 1
  Created user 9

Dump the user so it gets mirrored over to Review Board

  $ rbmanage dump-user user4 > /dev/null

The user should not have an ldap username associated with them

  $ rbmanage dump-user-ldap user4
  no ldap username associated with user4

Trigger automatic association

  $ rbmanage associate-employee-ldap --email user4@example.com
  user4@example.com associated with user4@example.com

The user should now have an associated ldap_username with appropriate logs

  $ rbmanage dump-user-ldap user4
  ldap username: user4@example.com
  $ mozreview exec rbweb grep -i ldap /reviewboard/logs/reviewboard.log | tail -n 1
  ????-??-?? ??:??:??,??? - INFO -  - Associating user: user4@example.com with ldap_username: user4@example.com (glob)

Create another user, where their username is different from their Bugzilla address

  $ mozreview create-user user5@example.com user5password 'User Five [:user5]' --uid 2004 --scm-level 1
  Created user 10
  $ rbmanage dump-user user5 > /dev/null
  $ mozreview delete-ldap-user user5@example.com
  $ mozreview create-ldap-user me@example.org user5 2004 'User Five [:user5]' --scm-level 1 --bugzilla-email=user5@example.com

Trigger automatic association

  $ rbmanage associate-employee-ldap --email user5@example.com

  $ mozreview exec rbweb grep -i ldap /reviewboard/logs/reviewboard.log | tail -n 1
  ????-??-?? ??:??:??,??? - INFO -  - Associating user: user5@example.com with ldap_username: me@example.org (glob)

Update Bugzilla address and reassociate

  $ mozreview delete-ldap-user me@example.org
  $ mozreview create-ldap-user you@example.org user5 2004 'User Five [:user5]' --scm-level 1 --bugzilla-email=user5@example.com
  $ rbmanage associate-employee-ldap --email user5@example.com

  ????-??-?? ??:??:??,??? - INFO -  - Existing ldap association 'me@example.org' replaced by 'you@example.org' (glob)

Create two users with the same Bugzilla address

  $ mozreview create-user user6@example.com user6password 'User Six [:user6]' --uid 2005 --scm-level 1 --bugzilla-email conflict@example.com
  Created user 11
  $ mozreview create-user conflict@example.com conflictpassword 'Conflict [:conflict]' --uid 2006 --scm-level 1
  Created user 12

Dump the users so they are mirrored over to Review Board, then delete the
associations this created.

  $ rbmanage dump-user user6 > /dev/null
  $ rbmanage associate-ldap-user user6 none > /dev/null
  $ rbmanage dump-user conflict > /dev/null
  $ rbmanage associate-ldap-user conflict none > /dev/null

Trigger automatic association and check the logs

  $ rbmanage associate-employee-ldap --email conflict@example.com
  LDAP association failed.
  $ mozreview exec rbweb grep -i ldap /reviewboard/logs/reviewboard.log | tail -n 1
  ????-??-?? ??:??:??,??? - INFO -  - Could not update ldap association: More than one match for conflict@example.com (glob)

Ensure automatic association doesn't overwrite existing valid associations.

  $ mozreview create-user user7@example.com user7password 'User Seven [:user7]'
  Created user 13
  $ mozreview create-ldap-user uSeven@example.org uSeven 2007 'User Seven' --scm-level 1
  $ rbmanage dump-user user7 > /dev/null
